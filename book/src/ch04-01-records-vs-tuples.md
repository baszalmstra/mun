## Records vs Tuples

Mun supports two types of structures: _record structs_ and _tuple structs_.
A record `struct` definition specifies both the name and type of each piece of data, allowing you to retrieve the _field_ by name.
For example, Listing 4-1 shows a record `struct` that stores a 2-dimensional vector.

```

In contrast, tuple `struct` definitions omit field names; only specifying the field types.
Using a tuple `struct` makes sense when you want to associate a name with a tuple or distinguish it from other tuples' types, but naming each field would be redundant.
Listing 4-2 depicts a tuple `struct` that stores a 3-dimensional vector.

### Create a Struct Instance

To use a record `struct`, we create an _instance_ of that struct by stating the name of the `struct` and then add curly braces containing `key: value` pairs for each of its fields.
The keys have to correspond to the field names in the `struct` definition, but can be provided in any order.
Let's create an instance of our `Vector2`, as illustrated in Listing 4-3.

```

To create an instance of a tuple `struct`, you only need to state the name of the `struct` and specify a comma-separated list of values between round brackets - as shown in Listing 4-4.
As values are not linked to field names, they have to appear in the order specified by the `struct` definition.

```

#### Field Init Shorthand

It often makes sense to name function variables the same as the fields of a record `struct`.
Instead of having to repeat the `x` and `y` field names, the _field init shorthand syntax_ demonstrated in Listing 4-5 allows you to avoid repetition.

```

### Access Struct Fields

To access a record's fields, we use the dot notation: `vector.x`.
The dot notation can be used both to retrieve and to assign a value to the record's field, as shown in Listing 4-6.
As you can see, the record's name is used to indicate that the function expects two `Vector2` instances as function arguments and returns a `Vector2` instance as result.

```

</span>

A tuple `struct` doesn't have field names, but instead accesses fields using indices - starting from zero - corresponding to a field's position within the struct definition (see Listing 4-7).

### Unit Struct

Sometimes it can be useful to define a `struct` without any fields.
These so-called _unit structs_ are defined using the `struct` keyword and a name, as shown in Listing 4-8.
